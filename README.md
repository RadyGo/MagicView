# MagicView

This project only supports Visual Studio 2015, 2017 x64.

Basic implementation for viewing polyhedral mesh based on Qt GUI.

Now this code includes a basic implementation for OpenGL rendering, arcball and primitive selection for user interaction.

Dependencies: [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/) and [Qt5](https://www1.qt.io/developers/). Install CGAL and Qt for Windows first. 

## GUI Example
This example shows loading a large mesh.

## Before using cmake to generate project
### Make sure the following environment variables are set: <br />
BOOST_LIBRARYDIR = ${BOOST_LOCAL_DIR}\lib64-msvc-xx.0 <br />
BOOST_INCLUDEDIR = ${BOOST_LOCAL_DIR} <br />
CGAL_DIR = ${CGAL_LOCAL_DIR} <br />
Qt5_DIR = ${Qt5_LOCAL_DIR}\5.xx.0\msvcxxxx_64

### Add the following environment variables to PATH: <br />
${BOOST_LOCAL_DIR}\lib64-msvc-14.0 <br />
${CGAL_LOCAL_DIR}\auxiliary\gmp\lib <br />
${CGAL_LOCAL_DIR}\build\bin <br />
${Qt5_LOCAL_DIR}\5.xx.0\msvcxxxx_64\bin <br />
${Qt5_LOCAL_DIR}\5.xx.0\msvcxxxx_64\plugins\platforms

## After building the project
